# Impact of Number of Nutritions

This data science study examines the relationship between calories of the recipe and their corresponding number of ingredients. This is a project for DSC 80 at UC San Diego.

## Project Introduction

In the constantly-evolving world of gastronomy, where the combination of culinary art and science is more pronounced than ever, understanding the nutritional aspects of what we eat has become essential. This project explores a fascinating area of culinary analytics: the relationship between the number of ingredients and carolies in a recipe. 

The central question of our analysis is: **Is there a relationship between the number of ingredients a recipe requires and its calorie content?** This question is not just of academic interest but of practical significance in our daily lives.


### Datasets Used in the project

We based our analysis on two comprehensive datasets.

The first dataset contains information of a variety of recipes that have been posted on food.com since 2008. This dataset contains 83782 unique recipes with `name` as its index column and 11 other columns conveying the following information:

| Column          | Description   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `name`          | Recipe name   |
| `id`            | Recipe ID     |
| `minutes`       | Minutes to prepare recipe |
| `contributor_id`| User ID who submitted this recipe |
| `submitted`     | Date recipe was submitted |
| `tags`          | Food.com tags for recipe |
| `nutrition`     | Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| `n_steps`       | Number of steps in recipe |
| `steps`         | Text for recipe steps, in order |
| `description`   | User-provided description |
| `ingredients`   | List of ingredients requried for the recipe |
| `n_ingredients` | Number of ingredients required for the recipe |

The second dataset contains information of reviews and ratings submitted for the recipes through food.com, which conveys 731927 reviews with `user_id` as its index column and 4 other columns conveying the following information:

| Column          | Description   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `user_id`       | User ID       |
| `recipe_id`     | Recipe ID     |
| `date`          | Date of interaction |
| `rating`        | Rating given  |
| `review`        | Review text   |

In our project, we mainly used `n_ingredients` column and `calories` column that we added to our dataset by extracting calories information from `nutrition` column. We also inspected `rating`, `review`, and `minutes` columns to examine missingness of certain values.

## Assessment of Missingness
This section of the study will examine missingness in certain columns on the combined dataset.

### NMAR Analysis

In the study of missing data mechanisms, Not Missing At Random (NMAR) refers to a situation in which a data point's likelihood of being missing is directly related to its value itself, whether observed or not. This mechanism is particularly pertinent to the `review` column in our dataset, where it is possible to infer that a user's experience with the recipe is the explanation behind the absence of a review.

Users are not as likely to submit reviews unless they have specific critiques or complaints about the recipe. A user's subjective experience often influences their decision to write a review; feedback is likely to be generated by particularly pleasant or negative experiences with the recipe. On the other hand, if an encounter does not leave an impression or elicit a strong response - possibly because the recipe is thought to be mediocre or unremarkable - may result in a lack of desire to write a review.

This pattern suggests that the missingness of data in `review` column is potentially NMAR as the absence of a review may correlate with unobserved, experiential factors inherent to the recipe. Understanding this missingness mechanism is crucial to our research as it highlights the necessity for specialized statistical methods that can take into account any bias that may have been introduced by the NMAR data.
